## How to Install or Use

## How to Modify or Develop
### Sass
Now, we use sass for writing css simply, so you should have sass compiler installed.  
Check if sass already installed.
```
sass -v
> Sass 3.4.13 (Selective Steve)
```

### Gulp
Now, we use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tool, make css file concat and compress. Running below code at project root path.
```
sudo npm install
```
This command will install all dependencies, then run:
```
sudo gulp
```
This command will running default task in `Gulpfile.js`. The task will watch all your `*.scss` file, and parse `cuckoo.scss` file when any change saved. You can read `Gulpfile.js` for more detail info.

### CSS Color Reference
- [NIPPON COLORS - Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆ‰ºùÁµ±Ëâ≤](http://nipponcolors.com/)
